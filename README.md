# Image Naming based on Date

Imagine you have used an iPhone for your entire life. Now imagine you have been backuping all of its photos and videos in the Photos app on your mac when, all of a sudden, you decided to install Windows because semester is over (yay!). Guess what? You lost all of the Mac partitions just because you need to expand the Windows storage in order to be able to play the new Modern Warfare. You then managed to get nearly all of the photos back by using free partition recovery software. What did that leave you with? A huge 64gb load of mess. That includes 

With this program, I wanted to solve the date classification by putting the date in front of the filename, so that the file explorer (in my case: Nautilus, because Linux > Mac > Windows ) will show the earlier photo first.

Requirements:
- Image Magick
- \*NIX (because Windows suck!)
